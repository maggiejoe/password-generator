# Password Generator


## Description
This password generator spits out a password based on prompts asking the user to confirm what criteria they would like in their password.


## Challenges

My biggest challenge was putting the for loop together. With some assistance from the BCS they helped me realize I was missing an index variable. Once I added that, my password generated not only numbers but all the criteria.

Another challenge was with asking for the password length from the user. If the user doesn't put in any character number and leaves it empty, I tried to prompt the user that "" or null is not a valid input. I was unable to figure out how to correct this issue right away and will be working on figuring this out and re-sbumitting. 

I am taking steps to understand JavaScript better outside of class by taking free online courses in addition to reviewing the resources material provided by the TA's.

I used the bootcamp module in addition to the robot gladiators program as a reference. 

I was intoduced to `concat` from an learning assistant with the BCS and he explained what it was and its uses.
